I'm a fullstack software engineer but also a digital designer at heart. My passion thrives in frontend web development where I carefully build mobile-first responsive designs. Currently focused on honing my craft in order to forge better and unforgettable user experiences. 
I'm looking to join a team of creative designers and developers. If you think I am a good fit, let's partner up.
